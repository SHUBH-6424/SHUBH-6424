👋 Hi, I’m @SHUBH-6424
👀 I’m interested in data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and data visualization.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced statistical techniques, programming languages such as Python and R, and exploring various data analysis tools and frameworks.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data analysis, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making.
📫 You can reach me via email at shubh6424@example.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at [insert LinkedIn profile link].
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a bike lover! When I'm not crunching numbers and analyzing data, you can often find me exploring new trails and scenic routes on my bike. It's a great way to unwind and stay active while enjoying the outdoors.
